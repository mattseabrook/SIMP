                   ------------------------------
                   GNU Image Manipulation Program
                         2.10 Stable Branch
                   ------------------------------

This is a stable release in the GIMP 2.10 series.

GIMP 2.10 replaces earlier GIMP 2.x versions. It is advised that you
uninstall them before installing GIMP 2.10. If you want to keep your
older GIMP 2.x installation in parallel to GIMP 2.10, you have to
choose a separate prefix which is not in your default library search
path. Otherwise your previous GIMP installation will start to use the
new libraries. You have been warned.

If you think you found a bug in this version, please make sure that it
hasn't been reported earlier and that it is not just new stuff that is
still being worked on and obviously not quite finished yet.

If you want to hack on GIMP, please read the file HACKING. For
detailed installation instructions, see the file INSTALL.


1. Web Resources

We also have a website dedicated to documentation at:

        https://docs.gimp.org/

        https://developer.gimp.org/

In particular, you may want to look in the "Core Development" section. Some
articles of particular interest for newcomers could be:

* GIMP Coding Style: https://developer.gimp.org/core/coding_style/
* Submit your first patch: https://developer.gimp.org/core/submit-patch/


3. Discussion Channels
======================

We have several discussion channels dedicated to GIMP user and
development discussion. There is more info at:

        https://www.gimp.org/discuss.html

For the real junkies, there are IRC channels (e.g. #gimp or #gimp-user)
devoted to GIMP on GIMPNet (a private free software oriented network).
Many of the developers hang out there. Some of the GIMPNet servers are:

	irc.gimp.org:6667
	irc.us.gimp.org:6667
	irc.eu.gimp.org:6667

More discussion channels, such as forums, will be listed on the above
"discuss" page when they are moderated by a team member.
Links to archives of former discussion methods (e.g. mailing lists) are
also included in that page.


4. Customizing
==============

The look of GIMP's interface can be customized like any other GTK app
by editing the ~/.gtkrc-2.0 file or by using "themes" (ready-made
customizations).  For downloadable themes and further details, see
http://art.gnome.org/themes/gtk2 . Additionally, GIMP reads the file
~/.config/GIMP/2.10/gtkrc so you can have settings that only apply to GIMP.

Included is a set of keybindings similar to those in Adobe Photoshop.
You can find them in the ps-menurc file.  To use them, copy this file
to ~/.config/GIMP/2.10/menurc. You can also manually change the keybindings
to any of your choice by editing ~/.config/GIMP/2.10/menurc.
